# seating-chart-algorithm

Command to run algorithm (at least on Windows, but it's most likely similar in other environments. I'm not an expert):

java -jar Algorithm.jar chartFile.json employeeFile.json similarityFile.json

If the program runs successfully, a file called Output.json will be created in the current directory.

Test files:

c32.json, c64.json, and c250.json are chart files for offices with 32, 64, and 250 desks, respectively.

e32.json, e64.json, and e250.json are employee files with 32, 64, and 250 employees, respectively.

s32.json, s64.json, and s250.json are similarity files with 32, 64, and 250 employees, respectively.
